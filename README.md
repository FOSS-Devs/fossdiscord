# FossiumBot
Welcome to the GitHub page of FossiumBot!
The bot is written in C# using .NET and [DSharpPlus](https://dsharpplus.github.io).

## Installing
Installation is pretty easy, just download the [latest release](https://github.com/Fossium-Team/FossiumBot/releases/latest), unzip, and run the excecutable.\
Make sure you have enabled all intents on your bot's page.\
If you can't use the commands right away, don't worry, slash commands can take some time to register (registering can take up to an hour, this is due to Discord's limitations).

If you want to use the latest build of the bot for whatever reason check out the [actions](https://github.com/Fossium-Team/FossiumBot/actions) (you need to be logged in to GitHub).\
For experimental MacOS, ARM and ARM64 builds also check out the [actions](https://github.com/Fossium-Team/FossiumBot/actions) (again, you need to be logged in to GitHub).
